Blazor:
-------
       Blazor is an open-source web framework developed by Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive web user 
interfaces using C# and HTML. It enables developers to create web applications using .NET languages without having to rely on JavaScript. 

Blazor offers two hosting models:
 1.Blazor Server and 
 2.Blazor WebAssembly.
 
1.Blazor Server:
----------------
         In the Blazor Server model, the application's logic runs on the server, and UI updates are sent to the client over a SignalR connection. 
The client's web browser renders the UI based on the updates received from the server. This model provides a familiar development experience 
similar to traditional server-side web frameworks. 

2.Blazor WebAssembly:
----------------------
         Blazor WebAssembly (often referred to as "Blazor WASM") allows developers to run .NET code directly in the browser using WebAssembly. 
With this model, the entire application, including both the UI and the logic, is downloaded to the client's web browser and executed there.
This enables offline support and a richer client-side experience but requires the entire application to be downloaded, 
which can result in larger initial load times.

           Blazor Server is suitable for applications where minimizing client-side resources and initial loading time is a priority, 
while Blazor WebAssembly is suitable for applications that require offline support, real-time updates, and a richer client-side experience,
even at the cost of longer initial loading times. The choice between the two hosting models depends on the specific 
requirements and priorities of the application being developed.

Benefits of Repository:
-----------------------
-Code is cleaner,easier resuse and maintain
-Enables to ensure loosely coupled systems
-it is easy to mock and replace a real repository with a fake implementation 
  for unit testing
